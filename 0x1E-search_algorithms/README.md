# Search Algorithms
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX SE School**. It aims to learn about search algorithms(binary,linear) in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.2.1
* C files are compiled using `gcc 7.5`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-linear.c` | script that searches for a value in an array of integers using the **Linear search algorithm** |
| `1-binary.c` | script that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the **Binary search algorithm** |
| `100-jump.c` | script that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the **Jump search algorithm** |
| `102-interpolation.c` | script that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the **Interpolation search algorithm** |
| `103-exponential.c` | script that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the **Exponential search algorithm** |
| `104-advanced_binary.c` | script that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers |
| `105-jump_list.c` | script that searches for a value in a sorted list of integers using the **Jump search algorithm** |
